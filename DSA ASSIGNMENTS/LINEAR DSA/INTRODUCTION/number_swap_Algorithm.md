step4: Take input to store num1 and num2

step5: Display the two numbers before swapping

Step6: Store value of num1 in temporary variable as temp = num1

Step7: Assign value of num2 to num1 as num1 = num2

Step8: Assign value of temp to num2 as num2 = temp

Step9: Display the twonumbers after swapping
