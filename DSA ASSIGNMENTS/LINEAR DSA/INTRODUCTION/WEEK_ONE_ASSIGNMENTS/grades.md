# **Student Marks Average Program**

## **Description**

This C program calculates and displays the average marks for a student in three subjects: Physics, Chemistry, and Math. The program takes input from the user for various components (Assignment, Coursework, Midterm, and End of Term) of each subject, ensures that the marks are valid (between 0 and 100), and calculates the average marks for each subject as well as the overall average across all three subjects.

## **Features**

The program will prompt the user to enter marks for Physics in four categories: Assignment, Coursework, Midterm, and End of Term.

The user must input a value between 0 and 100. If an invalid value is entered, the program will ask the user to enter the value again.

## **Enter the Marks for Chemistry:**

The program will prompt the user to enter marks for Chemistry in four categories.

Similar to Physics, input must be between 0 and 100.

## **Enter the Marks for Math:**

The program will prompt the user to enter marks for Math in four categories.

Input validation will ensure that the marks entered are valid.
